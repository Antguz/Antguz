I am Postdoctoral Associate at the [Cavender-Bares Lab](https://cbs.umn.edu/cavender-bares-lab/home) in the Ecology, Evolution and Behavior Department of the [University of Minnesota](https://cbs.umn.edu/academics/departments/eeb). I am an ecologist by training with a particular interest in linking plant ecophysiology, remote sensing, and modelling. By linking these fields, my aim is to better understand the dynamics that prevail in the ecosystems that can have a meaningful impact on environmental management. I am passionate about data, technology, and open-software and its application for the public benefit. More information about my research and experience can be found at my [personal website](https://www.jaguzmanq.com) or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J-Antonio-Guzman-Q) profile.
